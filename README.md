Project Title: Results Summary Component

This README file is a personal note to self to record the things I learnt, found challenging, and problems I am yet to solve so I can revisit in future for reference purposes.

Things this file will touch: dynamically generating content from JSON file, and SASS.

This is my first practice project where I combine the capabilities of dynamically generating content from a JSON file and using SASS for styling. I don't think I am ever going back to the normal way of writing code after this.

What I like most about using JSON files to generate content for the webpage is how clean it makes my HTML, while still giving me the full capability, if not even more, to select HTML elements to be manipulated in JavaScript.

Combining this with the capabilities of SASS makes the project/work more fun. 

I think there is more to JSON than this and I will do more research on how to take the fullest advantage of it.
